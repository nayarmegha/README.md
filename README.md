# Hello, World! ðŸŒŽâœ¨ðŸŒ¦

I'm Megha Nayar (pronounced may-gha). I study Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Chicago. I like to design and develop fun stuff for the internet (like my website!)

My projects include a dark mode I designed for the website "whopaystechnicalwriters.com" and my personal website that I designed on Figma, developed with React.js, and deployed using Netlify. 

Presently, I'm looking for a Software Engineering/Developer Internship for the Summer of 2024.

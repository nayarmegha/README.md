# Hello, World! ðŸŒŽâœ¨ðŸŒ¦

I'm Megha Nayar (pronounced may-gha). I study Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Chicago. I like to design and develop fun stuff for the internet (like my website!)

Presently, I'm looking for a Software Engineering/Developer Internship for the Summer of 2024.

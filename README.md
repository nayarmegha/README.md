# Hello, World! ðŸŒŽâœ¨ðŸŒ¦

I'm Megha Nayar (pronounced may-gha). I study Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Chicago. I like to design and develop for the web. 

Last summer, I joined Snap Inc. as a Software Engineering Intern :) Currently looking for new grad roles based in SF starting Jan 2025.
